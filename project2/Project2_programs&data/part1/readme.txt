The package of ECJ is applied in this problem.
The program code is mainly modified from Benchmarks.java in the following directory:

The parameters are set in xor.params.
In order to read trees easier, ECJ offers C-ish format.
Run the command as follow:
java ec.Evolve -file xor.params -p gp.tree.print-style=c
